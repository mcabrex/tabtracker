===========================CLIENT===========================


this is vue setup stuff you can just check the repo for more information
1. npm install -g vue-cli
    you can use it to build up template projects using vue
2. vue init webpack __insert_name_here__
    in this case were just gonna call it client
    itll take you step by step dont even fret bud
3. go into the client folder and npm i
    standard install stuff, install these dependencies locally in a node_modules folder
4. npm run dev
    thisll start up the vue.js frontend server set up at local8080 by default
    whenever you wanna come back to your code just hit up npm run dev again, should be all good in the hood even
5. commit your stuff to git, commit small and commit often ya silly
6. go out of the client folder and mkdir server 
    make a server folder seperate from the client folder so the client and the server dont overlap
    makes it a little easier to manage and control 

===========================SERVER===========================

1. npm init -f
    run this command in your new server folder
    first we initialize a new server project, we use this command to create a package.json and put it in our server folder
2. npm i --save-dev nodemon eslint
    nodemon useful for continuously restarting your server
3. go to your package.json and add a start script as well as a lint script
        "start" : "./node_modules/nodemon/bin/nodemon.js src/app.js --exec 'npm run lint && node'"
        "lint" : "./node_modules/.bin/eslint **/*.js"
    what this is gonna do is run nodemon over some file (src/app.js) which we'll make eventually and run a linter over the code as well as run the server (npm run lint && node)
4. ./node_modules/eslint/bin/eslint.js --init
    this is gonna initialize eslint for us
        >use a popular style guide
        >standard
        >Javascript
5. make a new folder in server and call it src and inside of that make a new file called app.js
    server => src => app.js
    inside that app.js we're going to define a web application
6. npm install --save express body-parser cors morgan
    then go ahead an require all of that
7. set up the express server 
    const app = express()
8. app.use all those dependencies
    besides express obvi

===========================REGISTER===========================
1. npm install --save axios
    a library for doing http requests to a backend
2. in your client folder create a folder called services and make a file called Api.js
    client => services => Api.js
    sets up a type of connector to hit the backend
3. create another file in services caled AuthenticationService.js
    hits register endpoint
